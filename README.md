# Bootcamp Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation for making this project was to make a good study guide for me and others so that when I am working on projects in the bootcamp, I have notes to refer to if I ever get stuck. I built this project to help supplement my learning in this bootcamp as a place of referral so that I can solve problems when I get lost. It solves the problem of needing a place to go back and refresh your memory when you forget how to do an earlier task. It is also a fun creative way to make notes as we go through this experience. The most important thing I learned from this project was how to use Git, as I had no prior experience with it. It taught me how to think through problems when trying to connect with Git and setting up important features like, the SSH keys. It helped me get even more comfortable with CLA.

## Usage

The way to use this webpage is to refer to it whenever you need to refresh your knowledge on Git, HTML, CSS or JavaScript. On the page itself there is 4 subheadings, one for each of the subjects listed before. You can look at the subheading you need information on and read the notes. If you open the DevTools (by right clicking and clicking "inspect") you'll see all the JavaScript features, which lists all the topics that was learned, and a suggestion of what you should study.
